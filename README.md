## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner.

### `npm run test:watch`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
